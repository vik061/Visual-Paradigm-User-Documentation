# Overview of Visual Paradigm Documentation

Welcome to the user documentation for the online version of Visual Paradigm! This documentation will cover instructions with detailed steps on some of the popular Visual Paradigm functions that are useful for creating neat and professional diagrams. In this document, the [*online version* of Visual Paradigm](https://online.visual-paradigm.com/) is used, not be confused with the [Visual Paradigm program](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/).


The goal of the user documentation for Visual Paradigm is to help anyone interested in making a diagram online with an option to not register for an account, as well as not downloading any programs to their device. Our target audience also includes CST students who need to draw diagrams for certain assignments, such as creating Entity Relationship Diagrams for Business Analysis and System Design. 

The topics for this document consist of the following:
- Creating a new diagram on Visual Paradigm
- Creating a diagram with shapes and connected lines
- Downloading a PDF copy of your diagram to your device

## How we planned and collaborated

We started brainstorming on potential topics that we could work on for the user documentation project. After receiving feedback from our instructor, we decided to create a user documentation on the online version of Visual Paradigm. 

Our main form of communication was through Discord, along with in-person working sessions to collaborate on this document. Git version control source and GitHub were used to regularly update our work.

## How we created this guide

This documentation was created based on our experiences using various softwares for certain courses during the CST diploma program. After seeing the vast options of tools that the online version of Visual Paradigm displayed, we thought about creating a user documentation that went over essential instructions to reach the end goal of handing in a professional-looking PDF copy of a diagram.

### Using MkDocs

This documentation used Material for MkDocs as our MkDoc theme to provide a professional appearance for our documentation. We also customized some stylings to match the colours presented on the online version of Visual Paradigm.

### Using Markdown

This documentation was written in Markdown language.

### Using VS Code

We used VS Code to write the Markdown files that were pushed to our GitHub repository.

## How we improved readability

To improve the readability of this documentation, we employed different forms of media to enhance our instructions. Some of the media we employed in this documentation include screenshots with annotations and gifs to visually demonstrate the flow of our instructions. 

We used MkDocsâ€™ admonitions to emphasize specific messages that users would find beneficial as they read through our instructions.
